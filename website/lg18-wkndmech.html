I've been using <B>Exuberant Ctags, version 1.5, by Darren Hiebert</B> for the
past little bit now and really like this a lot.  As the name implies, it does
a pretty thorough job of scouring your source files for all sorts of useful
stuff -- function declarations, typedefs, enum's, variable declarations, macro
definitions, enum/struct/union tags, external function prototypes, and so
forth.  It continues on in the time honored tradition of providing a bazillion
options, but not to fear:  it's default behavior is sane and savvy and
provides a very nice OOBE*.

You should be able to find Darren's Exuberant Ctags (ctags-1.5.tar.gz was the
most recent version on sunsite and its mirrors at the time of writing) at any
sunsite mirror.  I happened across it in the Incoming directory.  You'll
probably find is somewhere under the /devel subdirectory now.  If you get
stuck and really can't find it, drop me a note and I'll see what I can do to
help.  This one is definitely worth having.
