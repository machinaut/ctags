<h1>What is ctags?</h1>

<p>
<strong>Ctags</strong> generates an index (or <i>tag</i>) file of language
objects found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily
located by a text editor or other utility. A <i>tag</i> signifies a language
object for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index
entry created for that object).
