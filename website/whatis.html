<h1>What is ctags?</h1>

<strong>Ctags</strong> generates an index (or <i>tag</i>) file of C language
objects found in C source and header files that allows these items to be
quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A <i>tag</i>
signifies a C language object for which an index entry is available (or,
alternatively, the index entry created for that object).

<p>
Alternatively, <strong>ctags</strong> can generate a cross reference file
which lists, in human-readable form, information about the various objects
found in a set of C language files.

<p>
Tag index files are supported by the <b>vi</b> editor and its
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/editors/vi/">derivatives</a>
(such as <a href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a>, <b>elvis</b>, <b>stevie</b>,
<b>xvi</b>) through the use of the "<code>:ta</code>" command, and by the
<b>emacs</b> editor through the use of the "<code>Meta-.</code>" command, both
of which locate the object associated with a name. There are other a number of
other editors which support tag files. A list of these is found <a
