<li><b><i>14 Nov 2001</i></b>
    <br>
    I really like the Exuberant Ctags program.  We [are] all indebted to
    Darren Hiebert for providing us with such a fine program.
    <p>

<li><b><i>5 Nov 2001</i></b>
    <br>
    CTags is great. I use it all the time now, and I
    have no idea how I got by without it before.
    <p>
</li>

<li><b><i>3 Nov 2001</i></b>
    <br>
    First of all, let me thank you for Exuberant Ctags.  I use this on a daily 
    basis and couldn't imagine life without it.
    <p>

    Hello!  I've been a devout user of ctags for the
    past 4 years - thanks for a great program!
    <p>

    Ctags is an absolutely amazing program now thanks to you.

    Your Ctags is by far the best ctags around.
    <p>
</li>

<li><b><i>29 May 2001</i></b>
    <br>
    Hi, I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your ctags
    implementation. I have used it for a few months now, and I can safely say
    it rocks! I have introduced it to everyone at work, and we're all ecstatic
    about it. People use it for Java, ASP, JavaScript and SQL development.
    Thanks to the ingenious plug-and-play support for adding parsers, I had no
    trouble adding parsers for JavaScript and SQL....
    <p>
    CTags is now one of the programs I could not survive without, so once
    again, a big thank you!

    BTW very impressive tool - I started using it with vim at work after
    seeing the 5.0 announcement and have found it a "must have".

    <br>
    I want to thank you again for ctags.  It keeps getting better and better;
    I get so used to the development environment made possible by tags in our
    C source, it's a blessing to be able to use the same habits whether it's
    C, perl, shell, or whatever.
    <p>

<li><b><i>2 Feb 2001</i></b>
    <br>
    Couldn't live w/o ctags. I don't know how I went so long without it.
    <p>

<li><b><i>26 Sep 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    In a new job and new to Unix, I was afraid I would have to write my own
    source analysis tools. Disappointed that the default version of ctags failed
    to properly identify the oddly formatted function definitions in my source I
    was thrilled to find your Exuberant Ctags! The clouds have parted and the
    sun is peeking through.

    <p>
    Thank you for your kind contribution to the free software library. Know that
    your work continues to make my life a little easier. I appreciate this.

    <p>
    May lady luck shine on you.

    Hi,

    <p>
    you mention on your web site that you've had no reports of your program
    being used in Antarctica, guess what?

    <p>
    I work for the British Antarctic Survey on software which runs a
    scientific radar system down at Halley (76 south, 26 west), Antarctica.
    The radar is controlled by a huge and complex system called Radops, on top
    of the QNX operating system.

    <p>
    Basically ctags makes writing new software and maintaining the system much
    easier, thanks.  I had previously relied on a horrible system of scripts
    to find function definitions.
    <br>[<i>Antarctica</i>]

<li><b><i>4 Jul 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    Thank U for the fact to support Python in ctags.
    <br>
    Recently I was puzzled in the case that I can't use ctags in python old
    version.
    <br>
    When I visited your site, I got the bright hope!!
    <p>
    I'm the fan of CTAGS!!
    <br>
    May the force with U.
    <br>[<i>Korea</i>]
    <p>

<li><b><i>23 Jun 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    I've been a VIM user for years (and a VI user for a long time), and
    finally today I decided to play w/ the ctags that came w/ my RedHat
    6.1 installation, and I was impressed to say the least, I kicked
    myself for not using it before. 
    <p>

    Then I found out (on Freshmeat.net) that there was a new version (4.0)
    with some more languages supported. Downloaded it, compiled and tested
    it w/ some awk and python code, worked great. And as I am a PHP-head,
    I stole some of the code from the awk and the python files and made a
    file to process php classes and functions, nothing revolutionary, but
    it works. 

    <p>
    Your code is clear, so even a dumb programmer like me could figure out
    what was going on, modified the appropriate files, and got the
    modified ctags working in under half and hour. I am including the
    "<code>diff -c</code>" files so you can patch your code.

    <p>
    When I get some more time to play w/ ctags (downloaded at 2:50am, it
    is 3:30am now), I'll add more to the <code>php.c</code> so it'll recognize
    methods, variable definitions, etc.

    <p>
    Great tool man!
    <p>

<li><b><i>12 Jun 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    First, LOVE ctags!!!
    Now that I've buttered you up ... just kidding ... I LOVE ctags!  ;-)
    <p>

<li><b><i>05 Jun 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    First, thanx for producing the useful CTAGS tool.  My colleagues and I use
    it all the time, and it comes in very handy when reviewing software source
    files that have been written by others.
    <p>

<li><b><i>16 May 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    First let me thank you (over and over again) for the Exuberant ctags
    you've written for the variety of platforms.
    <p>


<li><b><i>10 May 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    Thank you for the wonderful ctags program. I'm using it
    for a parser I'm writing that works with C/C++ code....
    <p>
    PS. I know you've heard this several times also, but your
    code is really easy to read, and makes the whole process of
    understanding so much... nicer. Thanks again.
    <p>

<li><b><i>10 Apr 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    Thanks for doing such a wonderful job; this ctags is *FAR* superior to the
    stock one that came with the system (HP-UX).
    <p>

<li><b><i>02 Feb 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    Exuberant ctags is just what I have been looking for for ages - I have
    been trying to do it all in Perl (albeit wrongly no doubt with numerous
    regex's) but I must say ctags is spot on!
    <p>

<li><b><i>26 Jan 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    I've been looking at your code, and I'm very impressed, and I'm not easily
    impressed.
    <p>

<li><b><i>13 Jan 2000</i></b>
    <br>
    Your ctags utility allows for much better software engineering practices -
    and without being tied to the heavyweight utilities provided by compiler
    manufacturers. We will be using ctags as a major component for our C++
    build process. It now allows us to define error and message enumerators on
    a per-class basis rather than as a global resource. Also, many thanks for
    your very prompt attention in the whole area of technical support.
    <br>[<i>United Kingdom</i>]
    <p>

<li><b><i>08 Dec 1999</i></b>
    <br>
    Thank you very much for taking on the task of looking after ctags. It is
    really very much appreciated. My company are planning on using ctags for
    many of our software maintenance and development tasks. After all this
    <br>[<i>United Kingdom</i>]
    <p>

<li><b><i>07 Dec 1999</i></b>
    <br>
    I've been using Exuberant Ctags for awhile now.  It's really great,
    useful program.  I've integrated tag-hyperlinking into my editor, and
    I'm now addicted to tags.  I've written my own tags programs for
    various assembly languages (simple to parse) using Perl.  
    <p>

<li><b><i>15 Sep 1999</i></b>
    <br>
    We wish to take this opportunity to thank you for support. ctags has
    revolutionary changed our way of developing our models.

    your code is very clean. 
    <p>

<li><b><i>07 Jul 1999</i></b>
    <br>
    Hi Darren, let me congratulate you for this excellent tool.
    <br>[<i>Germany</i>]
    <p>

<li><b><i>14 Jun 1999</i></b>
    <br>
    Many thanks for making the ctags package freely available. Its a 
    great package. I particularly like the C++ support. I'm working on 
    a telecommunications system with approximately 150 C++ classes. 
    Being able to immediately get to the definition of C++ items 
    easily and quickly via ctags makes work a joyful experience.
    <p>

<li><b><i>19 Mar 1999</i></b>
    <br>
    I use your ctags here at work, and wanted to thank you for writing such a
    nice software package.  I like it so much more than the normal ctags
    program.... Thank you so much for writing such a great package!
    <p>

<li><b><i>05 Mar 1999</i></b>
    <br>
    I am just glad that such great software is avaiable out there.  Most ctags
    on Unix simply blow chunks!  Yours is absoulutely fantastic and has saved
    me numerous hours of wasted time. I have even managed to get the project
    managament here to make it sort of a standard, though it had to be
    installed as vtags so it would not confuse the curmudgeons still using the
    broken ctags that comes with the system.  When used with vim, it works
    absolutely fantastic.  I hope I am not gushing here. :)
    <p>

<li><b><i>27 Jan 1999</i></b>

    Looks like nothing can spoil my ctags pleasure now

    <br>
    Exuberant Ctags is a great tool indeed!
    <br>[<i>Germany</i>]
    <p>

<li><b><i>11 Dec 1998</i></b>
    <br>
    In better news, I'm trying to convert all the developers here (30+) to use 
    ctags-3.0. Just finding enumeration fields will probably be enough for any
    of us to switch!
    <p>

<li><b><i>23 Oct 1998</i></b>
    <br>
    First off, I would like to thank you for creating Exuberant Ctags.  This 
    program completely kicks ass, if you'll pardon me for saying so.  :)
    <p>

<li><b><i>20 Oct 1998</i></b>
    <br>
    Well done on producing a very decent version of ctags. I use it at work
    and at home and find it very useful for navigating moderately sized
    projects. Thanks!
    <p>

<li><b><i>25 Sep 1998</i></b>
    <br>
    Thanks for Exuberant Ctags - it is quite an improvement over ctags,
    even gnu ctags.  
    <p>

<li><b><i>24 Sep 1998</i></b>
    <br>
    I just spent the last few days integrating your Ctags program into our
    build environment here.  On NT, Visual C++'s browse files don't work
    because our project is too large.  So, I wrote a plug-in for Visual Studio
    to use a tags file instead.  We are traditionally a Unix house and use
    tags elsewhere.  Anyway, Ctags goes through our source in about 8 minutes
    and generates a 20meg+ tags file (with lots of options turned off).
    That's pretty impressive speed and thoroughness.
    <p>
    Thanks a lot for creating a great tool!
    <p>

<li><b><i>17 Sep 1998</i></b>
    <br>
    Your ctags program is extremely useful and a key part of my development
    environment.  Thank you for writing it. I'm sure it will live a loooong
    life.
    <p>

<li><b><i>26 Aug 1998</i></b>

    Thanks for your great piece of software.  It has saved me the headache of

    ctags with C++ support.
    <p>

<li><b><i>05 May 1998</i></b>

    impressed with your ctags.exe program. In fact it is just amazing!

    <br>[<i>Australia</i>]
    <p>

<li><b><i>14 Mar 1998</i></b>
    <br>
    I would like to congradulate you on your implementation of Exuberant Ctags.
    <p>
    I have added master tag files for everything in /usr/include and I have
    a cron job to build master tag files for the linux kernel(which makes for 
    highly productive hack sessions when you have nearly the entire kernel
    at your fingertips). I often wonder how I got along for so many years 
    without it! In fact, I have converted users of the dreaded Microsoft(tm)
    MSDEV(tm) IDE(probably a TM here too) to VIM-5.0 for NT(tm) along with
    your implmentation of ctags because it was easier for them to navigate
    around the code!
    <p>
    Now, whenever I use a ctags that isn't yours, I feel crippled in my ability
    to write good code quickly. I love your enhancments to it.
    <p>
    Please keep up the good work! The world needs people like you. 
    <p>
    [<i>And later...</i>]
    <p>
    I love the fact that if one really hates some piece of software, they
    can get third party stuff written by people like you that are ten times
    better than the original product.
    ...Anyway. Once again, I thank you for writing such a valuable piece
    of art, and that is really what it is.
    <p>

<li><b><i>12 Mar 1998</i></b>

    Subject: exuberant ctags rocks!
    <p>
    ...gnu ctags didn't know squat about variables, structures, enums... etc.
    <p>
    After doing a search on the web for 'ctags' I found your
    extended ctags.  What a lifesaver.  This thing does almost
    everything a person could ask for.
    <p>
    It rocks, it rocks, it rocks.
    <p>

    its great stuff.
    <p>

    <br>
    I've just begun using your ctags program and it is indeed wonderful!
    <p>

<li><b><i>19 Feb 1997</i></b>
    <br>
    Wow!
    <p>
    I've been a vi/vim/ctags user for about 12 years now. Most of
    those 12 years I've been frustrated by various tags generators and
    wished someone would combine all the different features into a single
    program. And have it work. I've never found the time/energy to tackle
    that one (I've tackled enough other extracurricular programming). But,
    now you've done it! And in a big way!
    <p>
    Hats off, I bow to you and send many grateful thanks.

    <br>
    <code>main() { int i; for(i=0;i<10;i++) printf("WOWWOW\n");}</code>
    <p>
    Your new ctags is very very excellent.  Usually if I want to insert the
    <code>enum</code>'ed variable into tags file, I always had to
    "<code>grep/awk/grep/awk/grep/awk/</code>", then "<code>:%!sort</code>"
    in vi... a lot of trouble to me.  Furthermore, it can give me all the
    global variables, how excellent your package is!  And another thing.. is
    If a source file is something like this,
    <code>typedef void (*func_t)(const char **b, int c);</code>
    Then other ctags gives me a very very strange results to me, on the
    contrary your ctags gives me exact results.
    <p>
    I only downloaded your package about 2 hours ago, so there must be a lot
    of new improvement that I didn't find out yet.

    your coding style: very consistent and fairly easy to read.  It definitely
    shows when a software developer feels pride in their work.

    better than every other ctags I've used so far.

    <p>

<li><b><i>02 Apr 1996</i></b>
    <br>
    Wow!  I've just tried this out, and despite being the very first beta
    release of this program, it already seems to be the best ctags program
    I've seen.  Up to now I have been using the ctags that came with elvis,
    and I've just compared the output "tags" files.
    <p>
    The elvis ctags had lots of little tags for things that shouldn't have had
    tags (e.g. "<code>if</code>", "<code>return</code>", "<code>TRUE</code>",
    etc.), but this new ctags doesn't produce tags for those.  It does find
    several tags though that the elvis ctags could not (e.g.
    "<code>insstr</code>" in the vim code!).

    Wow!  All the bugs I reported last time have been fixed :-)  It does
    indeed seem very robust now.  Well done!
