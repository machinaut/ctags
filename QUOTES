CTags is great. I use it all the time now, and I
have no idea how I got by without it before.

---------------
3 Nov 2001
First of all, let me thank you for Exuberant Ctags.  I use this on a daily 
basis and couldn't imagine life without it.

---------------
23 Oct 2001
Hello!  I've been a devout user of ctags for the
past 4 years - thanks for a great program!

Your Ctags is by far the best ctags around.

29 May 2001
Hi, I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your ctags
implementation. I have used it for a few months now, and I can safely say it
rocks! I have introduced it to everyone at work, and we're all ecstatic about
it. People use it for Java, ASP, JavaScript and SQL development. Thanks to the
ingenious plug-and-play support for adding parsers, I had no trouble adding
parsers for JavaScript and SQL....

CTags is now one of the programs I could not survive without, so once again, a
big thank you!

BTW very impressive tool - I started using it with vim at work after
seeing the 5.0 announcement and have found it a "must have".

I want to thank you again for ctags.  It keeps getting better and better; I
get so used to the development environment made possible by tags in our C
source, it's a blessing to be able to use the same habits whether it's C,
perl, shell, or whatever.

2 Feb 2001
Couldn't live w/o ctags. I don't know how I went so long without it.

26 Sep 2000
In a new job and new to Unix, I was afraid I would have to write my own
source analysis tools. Disappointed that the default version of ctags failed
to properly identify the oddly formatted function definitions in my source I
was thrilled to find your Exuberant Ctags! The clouds have parted and the
sun is peeking through.

Thank you for your kind contribution to the free software library. Know that
your work continues to make my life a little easier. I appreciate this.

May lady luck shine on you.

Hi,

you mention on your web site that you've had no reports of your program being
used in Antarctica, guess what?

I work for the British Antarctic Survey on software which runs a scientific
radar system down at Halley (76 south, 26 west), Antarctica.  The radar is
controlled by a huge and complex system called Radops, on top of the QNX
operating system.

Basically ctags makes writing new software and maintaining the system much
easier, thanks.  I had previously relied on a horrible system of scripts to
find function definitions.

Thank U for the fact to support Python in ctags.
Recently I was puzzled in the case that I can't use ctags in python old version.
When I visited your site, I got the bright hope!!
I'm the fan of CTAGS!!
May the force with U.

I've been a VIM user for years (and a VI user for a long time), and
finally today I decided to play w/ the ctags that came w/ my RedHat
6.1 installation, and I was impressed to say the least, I kicked
myself for not using it before. 

Then I found out (on Freshmeat.net) that there was a new version (4.0)
with some more languages supported. Downloaded it, compiled and tested
it w/ some awk and python code, worked great. And as I am a PHP-head,
I stole some of the code from the awk and the python files and made a
file to process php classes and functions, nothing revolutionary, but
it works. 

Your code is clear, so even a dumb programmer like me could figure out
what was going on, modified the appropriate files, and got the
modified ctags working in under half and hour. I am including the
"diff -c" files so you can patch your code.

When I get some more time to play w/ ctags (downloaded at 2:50am, it
is 3:30am now), I'll add more to the php.c so it'll recognize methods,
variable definitions, etc.

Great tool man!

12 Jun 2000
First, LOVE ctags!!!
Now that I've buttered you up ... just kidding ... I LOVE ctags!  ;-)

---------------
05 Jun 2000
First, thanx for producing the useful CTAGS tool.  My colleagues and I use
it all the time, and it comes in very handy when reviewing software source
files that have been written by others.

---------------
16 May 2000
First let me thank you (over and over again) for the Exuberant ctags you've
written for the variety of platforms.

---------------
10 May 2000
Thank you for the wonderful ctags program. I'm using it
for a parser I'm writing that works with C/C++ code....

PS. I know you've heard this several times also, but your
code is really easy to read, and makes the whole process of
understanding so much... nicer. Thanks again.

---------------
10 Apr 2000
Thanks for doing such a wonderful job; this ctags is *FAR* superior to the
stock one that came with the system (HP-UX).

---------------
02 Feb 2000
Exuberant ctags is just what I have been looking for for ages - I have been
trying to do it all in Perl (albeit wrongly no doubt with numerous regex's)
but I must say ctags is spot on!

---------------
26 Jan 2000
I've been looking at your code, and I'm very impressed, and I'm not easily
impressed.

13 Jan 2000
Your ctags utility allows for much better software engineering practices -
and without being tied to the heavyweight utilities provided by compiler
manufacturers. We will be using ctags as a major component for our C++
build process. It now allows us to define error and message enumerators on
a per-class basis rather than as a global resource. Also, many thanks for
your very prompt attention in the whole area of technical support.
[United Kingdom]

08 Dec 1999
Thank you very much for taking on the task of looking after ctags. It is
really very much appreciated. My company are planning on using ctags for
many of our software maintenance and development tasks. After all this

07 Dec 1999
I've been using Exuberant Ctags for awhile now.  It's really great,
useful program.  I've integrated tag-hyperlinking into my editor, and
I'm now addicted to tags.  I've written my own tags programs for
various assembly languages (simple to parse) using Perl.  

---------------
15 Sep 1999
We wish to take this opportunity to thank you for support. ctags has
revolutionary changed our way of developing our models.

Many thanks for making the ctags package freely available. Its a 
great package. I particularly like the C++ support. I'm working on 
a telecommunications system with approximately 150 C++ classes. 
Being able to immediately get to the definition of C++ items 
easily and quickly via ctags makes work a joyful experience.

---------------
19 Mar 1999
I use your ctags here at work, and wanted to thank you for writing such a nice
software package.  I like it so much more than the normal ctags program....
Thank you so much for writing such a great package!

---------------
05 Mar 1999
I am just glad that such great software is avaiable out there.  Most ctags on
Unix simply blow chunks!  Yours is absoulutely fantastic and has saved me
numerous hours of wasted time. I have even managed to get the project
managament here to make it sort of a standard, though it had to be installed
as vtags so it would not confuse the curmudgeons still using the broken ctags
that comes with the system.  When used with vim, it works absolutely
fantastic.  I hope I am not gushing here. :)

In better news, I'm trying to convert all the developers here (30+) to use 
ctags-3.0. Just finding enumeration fields will probably be enough for any of 
us to switch!

23 Oct 1998
First off, I would like to thank you for creating Exuberant Ctags.  This 
program completely kicks ass, if you'll pardon me for saying so.  :)

---------------
20 Oct 1998
Well done on producing a very decent version of ctags. I use it at work and at
home and find it very useful for navigating moderately sized projects. Thanks!

---------------
25 Sep 1998
Thanks for Exuberant Ctags - it is quite an improvement over ctags,
even gnu ctags.  

---------------
24 Sep 1998
I just spent the last few days integrating your Ctags program into our
build environment here.  On NT, Visual C++'s browse files don't work
because our project is too large.  So, I wrote a plug-in for Visual Studio
to use a tags file instead.  We are traditionally a Unix house and use tags
elsewhere.  Anyway, Ctags goes through our source in about 8 minutes and
generates a 20meg+ tags file (with lots of options turned off).  That's
pretty impressive speed and thoroughness.

Thanks a lot for creating a great tool!

---------------
17 Sep 1998
Your ctags program is extremely useful and a key part of my development
environment.  Thank you for writing it. I'm sure it will live a loooong life.

---------------
26 Aug 1998
Thanks for your great piece of software.  It has saved me the headache of
creating my own little C++ parser for a Microsoft Visual Studio addin I was
writing.

24 Aug 1998
I love your ctags program and I've gotten all my co-workers to love it too.

First of all, let me congratulate you on the terrific 2.0 release of 
ctags with C++ support.

---------------
05 May 1998
I love the program.  It has the process of "figuring out" code much easier.

---------------
03 May 1998
I have just completed the task of changing Zeus [Win95 editor] to
support for your new tag file format and I have to say that I am very
impressed with your ctags.exe program. In fact it is just amazing!

14 Mar 1998
I would like to congradulate you on your implementation of Exuberant Ctags.

I have added master tag files for everything in /usr/include and I have
a cron job to build master tag files for the linux kernel(which makes for 
highly productive hack sessions when you have nearly the entire kernel
at your fingertips). I often wonder how I got along for so many years 
without it! In fact, I have converted users of the dreaded Microsoft(tm)
MSDEV(tm) IDE(probably a TM here too) to VIM-5.0 for NT(tm) along with
your implmentation of ctags because it was easier for them to navigate
around the code!

Now, whenever I use a ctags that isn't yours, I feel crippled in my ability
to write good code quickly. I love your enhancments to it.

Please keep up the good work! The world needs people like you. 

[And later...]

I love the fact that if one really hates some piece of software, they
can get third party stuff written by people like you that are ten times
better than the original product.
...Anyway. Once again, I thank you for writing such a valuable piece
of art, and that is really what it is.

---------------
12 Mar 1998
I just wanted to let you know that I have been looking for a program
just like ctags.... Definitely a service to the programming community!

Thank you very much for writing Exuberant Ctags. It has been extremely
useful!

I'm another enthusiastic fan of your exuberant ctags package; nice work! 
I use it to streamline all of my C programming.  I'm addicted ;-). 

---------------
03 Dec 1997
I just want to let you know that I really like your version of ctags.
I downloaded it about 6 months ago (probably need to update my copy)
and have been using it alot.

I love your ctags program and have used it for about a year now and think the
additions are great.

I've made heavy use of your Exuberant Ctags program this spring for my
Software Engineering and Data Structures courses at school -- coupled with
VIM this is a truly fantastic combo that saved my... er, *gluteus m.* on
several occasions!  Thanks SO much for a truly great program.

Subject: exuberant ctags rocks!

...gnu ctags didn't know squat about variables, structures, enums... etc.

After doing a search on the web for 'ctags' I found your extended ctags.
What a lifesaver.  This thing does almost everything a person could ask for.

It rocks, it rocks, it rocks.

---------------
21 Apr 1997
Hello.  One of my users told me about your ctags package.  They tell me
its great stuff.

---------------
27 Mar 1997
I've just begun using your ctags program and it is indeed wonderful!

---------------
19 Feb 1997
Wow!

I've been a vi/vim/ctags user for about 12 years now. Most of
those 12 years I've been frustrated by various tags generators and
wished someone would combine all the different features into a single
program. And have it work. I've never found the time/energy to tackle
that one (I've tackled enough other extracurricular programming). But,
now you've done it! And in a big way!

Hats off, I bow to you and send many grateful thanks.

02 Oct 1996
main() { int i; for(i=0;i<10;i++) printf("WOWWOW\n");}

Your new ctags is very very excellent.  Usually if I want to
insert the enum'ed variable into tags file, I always had to
"grep/awk/grep/awk/grep/awk/", then ":%!sort" in vi...
a lot of trouble to me.  Furthermore, it can give me all the global
variables, how excellent your package is!  And another thing.. is
If a source file is something like this,
    typedef void (*func_t)(const char **b, int c);
Then other ctags gives me a very very strange results to me, on the
contrary your ctags gives me exact results.

I only downloaded your package about 2 hours ago, so there must be a lot
of new improvement that I didn't find out yet.

Thank you
[Korea]

13 Aug 1996
...your ctags and your advice have and will save me countless hours hunting
down defines, functions, etc. Koodos for the effort and keep up the good
work.

---------------
06 Aug 1996
I've downloaded your ctags- it is great!!!  I have been pulling my hair
out trying to figure out how to do some of this.  The macros and extern'ed
functions are very, very helpful.  Also, I'd like to complement your on
your coding style: very consistent and fairly easy to read.  It definitely
shows when a software developer feels pride in their work.

02 Apr 1996
First let me thank you for the ctags program. It handles finding of tags
better than every other ctags I've used so far.
[Germany]

---------------
02 Apr 1996
Wow!  I've just tried this out, and despite being the very first beta
release of this program, it already seems to be the best ctags program
I've seen.  Up to now I have been using the ctags that came with elvis,
and I've just compared the output "tags" files.

The elvis ctags had lots of little tags for things that shouldn't have had
tags (e.g. "if", "return", "TRUE", etc.), but this new ctags doesn't produce
tags for those.  It does find several tags though that the elvis ctags could
not (e.g. "insstr" in the vim code!).

[And later...]

Wow!  All the bugs I reported last time have been fixed :-)  It does
indeed seem very robust now.  Well done!
[Australia]
